# The JSON string resulting from applying the json_tricks.dumps() function stores the module and class name.
# The class must be importable from the same module when decoding (and should not have changed).
# If it isn't, you have to manually provide a dictionary to cls_lookup_map when loading
# in which the class name can be looked up. Note that if the class is imported, then globals() is such a dictionary
# (so try loads(json, cls_lookup_map=glboals())).
# Also note that if the class is defined in the 'top' script (that you're calling directly),
# then this isn't a module and the import part cannot be extracted. Only the class name will be stored;
# it can then only be deserialized in the same script, or if you provide cls_lookup_map.
# That's why the following warning appears when serializing Band objects in this script:
# UserWarning: class <class '__main__.Band'> seems to have been defined in the main file;
# unfortunately this means that it's module/import path is unknown,
# so you might have to provide cls_lookup_map when decoding.
